# VO2 quick-start

A basic set of scripts, functions, and initial inputs for starting off with DFT on VO2.

* `qe-input` includes basic VO2 `m1` and `rut` phase inputs, together with scripts used for running on ETHZ Euler
* `pseudo` contains the necessary V and O pseudopotentials
* `scripts` includes example scripts for analyzing band structures and projected density of states (pdos)
* `example` includes an example of a calculated M1 structure
* `output` contains output plots from the various scripts
